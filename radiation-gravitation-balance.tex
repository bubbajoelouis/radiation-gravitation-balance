\begin{abstract}
This paper formalizes the balance between Gravitation and Radiation as a fundamental stabilizing mechanism of energy structures. We establish that true singularities (Black Holes as physical objects) cannot exist due to the recursive nature of energy storage and extension. Using a mathematical framework and a physical analogy, we show that mass structures persist due to the interaction between stored Gravitation and extended Radiation. The recursive dimensional framework provides a predictive model for stability, collapse, and energy transformations across scales.

\section{Introduction}
Energy structures are inherently stable due to the interaction between three fundamental energy states: Gravitation ($G$), Radiation ($R$), and Particulate Motion ($I$). Classical physics often assumes that extreme Gravitation leads to singularities, but the Unified Theory of Energy (UTE) posits that Radiation always extends outward to counterbalance this collapse. 

This paper demonstrates that the ratio $G/R$ never reaches infinity, meaning a true singularity is unattainable. Instead, what appears to be a "Black Hole" is simply a system observed at a vastly different Scale ($D_t$), where Radiation becomes unobservable.

\section{Mathematical Foundation}

The balance between stored Gravitation and extended Radiation follows the fundamental equation:
\begin{equation}
    G = R
\end{equation}

which must hold at the Surface of any Radiation Source. The theoretical limit as one attempts to observe an infinitely small region of stored Gravitation (the "center" of a Radiation Source) is:

\begin{equation}
    \lim_{r \to 0} \frac{G}{R} \neq \infty
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \lim_{r \to 0} \frac{R}{G} \neq \infty
\end{equation}


This establishes that no matter how deep one attempts to "zoom in" to an energy system, Radiation is always present in some form, preventing absolute collapse.

\section{The Particle-Water Column Analogy}
A useful analogy for understanding energy balance is a ball floating on a column of water:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \textbf{ball} represents a Particle within a Mass Structure.
    \item The \textbf{water column} represents Radiation being extended outward.
    \item Gravitation pulls the ball downward, while Radiation pushes it upward.
    \item If Radiation weakens (absorbed instead of extended), the ball sinks (Gravitation dominates).
    \item If Radiation strengthens (Overgravitation), the ball rises or is ejected (mass ejection, supernovae).
\end{itemize}
This analogy can be applied to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Star formation: Balance between Gravity and Radiation dictates star size and stability.
    \item Supernovae and fission events: Overextended Radiation leads to mass ejection.
    \item Plasma and electrical arcs: Forced Overgravitation leads to Radiation extension.
    \item Stable matter (atoms, planets, electrons): Achieving $G = R$ at the Surface results in stability.
\end{itemize}

\section{Recursive Dimensional Stability}
The recursive dimensional framework of energy storage and release follows:
\begin{equation}
    \lim_{D \to \infty} G(D) = \lim_{D \to \infty} R(D)
\end{equation}
where $D$ represents Degrees of Surface Interaction. This means:
\begin{itemize}
    \item At \textbf{D=1}, energy storage occurs at the most fundamental level (electrons, valence shells).
    \item At \textbf{D=2}, stored energy is exchanged at surface depths (heat transfer, phase changes).
    \item At \textbf{D=3}, mass structures undergo physical transformation (nuclear fission, planetary formation).
    \item At \textbf{D=4 and beyond}, recursive energy scaling leads to biological life and cognition.
\end{itemize}

\begin{theorem}
    The ratio of Gravitation to Radiation, denoted as \( \frac{G}{R} \), and its reciprocal, \( \frac{R}{G} \), never reach infinity at any Scale. That is:
    \begin{equation}
        \lim_{D_t \to 0} \frac{G}{R} \neq \infty, \quad \lim_{D_t \to \infty} \frac{R}{G} \neq \infty.
    \end{equation}
    where \( D_t \) is the Topological Dimension (Scale) defining the Radiation Coordinate System of the Mass Structure.
    
    \textbf{Proof:}  
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Gravitation (\( G \)) is stored Radiation and cannot exist in isolation. If \( G/R \to \infty \), this would imply that Radiation ceases to exist at some Scale, violating Theorem 1 of the Unified Theory of Energy, which states that all three energy states must coexist.
        \item Radiation (\( R \)) is extended Energy and cannot exist without Gravitation. If \( R/G \to \infty \), this would imply that Radiation is infinitely extended with no Mass Structure to store it, which contradicts conservation of energy at all Degrees of Surface Interaction.
        \item Even in extreme events such as supernovae, local and nested Radiation Coordinate Systems retain Gravitation at certain Degrees of Surface Interaction, ensuring the balance of stored and extended energy remains preserved.
    \end{enumerate}
    Therefore, at any Scale, neither Gravitation nor Radiation can reach a state of absolute dominance, and energy remains in a recursive state of balance.
\end{theorem}

\section{Conclusion}
This paper formalizes the balance between Gravitation and Radiation as the core stabilizing mechanism in energy structures. The Black Hole construct is a misinterpretation of energy recursion limitsâ€”Gravitation is never fully isolated from Radiation. By incorporating the recursive dimensional framework, we establish a predictive model for energy interactions across scales, with implications for astrophysics, particle physics, and even biological evolution.
